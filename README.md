# paystack2
The new Nodejs API wrapper for Paystack


This is a new project I'm not done structuring so you can't fork right now.

You might be thinking why a new Nodejs library if we already have one, well has it is now the current library is deprecated and no longer maintained also Paystack's api now has version 2.

So this will serve as a replacement and the maintaiment is guaranted by me
