# paystack2
The new Nodejs API wrapper for Paystack

You might be thinking why a new Nodejs library if we already have one, well as it is the current library is deprecated and is no longer maintained also Paystack's api now has version 2.

So this will serve as a replacement and I will make sure this is actively maintained

Note: This library uses version 2 api docs

 This libray is currently under development and has not been publish to npm yet follow the code in transaction.ts in the resource folder to structure write other resource
